    <section class="aboutcoffee" id="about">
      <p>
        Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
        bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
        primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the
        world market for hot drinks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce
        unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into
        fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
        producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or
        iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety
        of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed
        canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often
        added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
        closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
        evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day
        Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi
        shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
        similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. The coffee beans were
        procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
        intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink
        had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later
        spreading to Europe. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C.
        robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in
        the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian
        subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2023, Brazil was the leading grower of
        coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted
        coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee
        reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee beans
        disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have
        also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing
        of land for coffee-growing and water use. The global coffee industry is
        massive and worth $495.50 billion as of 2023. Brazil, Vietnam, and
        Colombia are the top exporters of coffee beans as of 2023. <br />

    <section class="grinder">
      <p>
        The coffee grinding process involves breaking down whole coffee beans
        into smaller particles to increase the surface area for extraction,
        ultimately enhancing flavor and aroma. Grinding coffee is arguably the
        most important in the entire coffee brewing process as coffee starts
        losing its aroma after 30 minutes after being grinded which makes
        grinding fresh essential when you want to extract every last ounce of
        flavor from your coffee. There are quite a few categories we can divide
        coffee grinders into, but let me explain the most important ones.

        <br />
        <br />

        First one is by the way grinder crushes coffee beans, so that would be
        blade and burr grinders. Blade grinders use spinning blades to chop
        coffee beans into uneven particles. They are typically more affordable
        but can produce inconsistent grind sizes and you should forget them
        right away. Burr grinders crush coffee beans between two abrasive
        surfaces (burrs) to achieve a more uniform grind. We can categorize them
        further into flat and conical burr configurations. We are not going to
        go into details when it comes to types of burrs this time.
        <br />
        <br />

        Second category would be how the grinder is powered so it's either
        manual or electric. Manual ones can be cheaper and smaller but electric
        ones are definitely more convenient.
        <br />
        <br />

        Third category is what grinder is specified for, so can be espresso or
        brewing grinder. Here, typically espresso grinders are more powerful and
        expensive as they need to grind really fine to produce an espresso type
        beverage.

        <br />
        <br />

        Of course we can categorize further, by the material of the burs,
        material of casing, single dose and hopper grinders, with stepped or
        stepless adjustment and so on, but I would describe 3 above mentioned
        categories as the main ones.

      <div class="pourover">
        <h3>Pour over</h3>

        <p>
          this is your standard auto-drip machine or the manual pourover method.
          You pass hot water over ground coffee (remember freshly ground is
          highly recommended) and there’s a paper filter that catches oils and
          sediments. The coffee drips through and voila, you have your brew!
          Auto-drip is by far the most common method used in most homes, while
          manual pour-over has regained popularity with recent coffee
          connoisseurs because it offers better control over brewing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="imersion">
        <h3>Imersion</h3>
        <p>
          This technique involves the ground coffee having constant contact with
          hot or cold water for a certain amount of time, extracting the flavors
          from coffee into the water. Filtration happens in one go at the end.
          French press, aeropress and toddy brewing system are all examples of
          this method.

      <div class="percolation">
        <h3>Percolation</h3>
        <p>
          the last method is percolation where the water is boiling through
          finely ground coffee and collecting as coffee above it. Stovetop
          coffee makers and mokapots are examples of this technique.

      <div class="vacuumfiltration">
        <h3>Vacuum filtration</h3>
        <p>
          this is the siphon and other funky-looking but also very finicky
          methods used in some cafes. I’ve only tried coffee from this system
          once, and wasn’t impressed for the amount of work that goes into this.
          This is best viewed in a display case since it looks so cool.
